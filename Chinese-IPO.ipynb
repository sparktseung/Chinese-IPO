    "About two years ago, I started to have some extra money for investing. After a few trial-and-errors, I have resorted to regular purchase of a low-fee Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) tracking the US market index - the cost of \"beating the market\" just seems too high, and an average of 7~8% per year is already a very decent return.\n",
    "\n",
    "I have been all content with that until a friend of mine mentioned the unbelievably high return on purchasing the Initial Public Offerings (IPO) of Chinese stocks. He claimed that, if you are lucky enough to be assigned some units during an IPO, the return on the first day of public trading is quite significant (e.g. 100%+). However, it is generally quite difficult to obtain those IPOs in the first place, so it is almost like buying a lottery.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfamiliar with, and intentially staying away from, the Chinese stock market, I was quite suspicious at first, but a quick search on the Internet has my confidence shaken. Therefore, being a student in statistics, I naturally started to dig into a pool of data, trying to find out if one can make some big money from Chinese stock IPOs."
